Accessibility statement generator
=================================
Not providing accessibility accommodation information without request creates unintentional barriers to participation in workshops, conferences, and other events for disabled/chronically ill researchers.  Providing information on what accommodations are or are not possible in a given instance can mean the difference between a chronically ill/disabled research being able to do research that day, or spending his/her available energy trying to see if they are even able to attend an event.  However, attempts to encourage organizers to include this information have so far been unsuccessful, suggesting that the task of generating such a statement is quite challenging.  This generator hopes to remove some of the difficulty for organizers by providing a simple tool to automatically create an accessibility statement based on a few simple questions, which can then be copied and pasted into an email or flier announcing the event.
